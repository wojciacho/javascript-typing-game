# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is a typing game.
This app is adding random word from api.
You can also set difficulty levels in this game.

Difficulty levels:
* Easy - is adding 8 seconds to the time
* Medium - is adding 6 seconds to the time
* Hard - is adding 4 seconds to the time


I used the fetch method to request data from a server.
* Server I used: https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/

Inspiration to this project I got from udemy course created by Brad Traversy.
